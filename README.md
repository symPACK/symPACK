# Configuring and building symPACK
--------------------------


**symPACK** is a sparse symmetric matrix direct linear solver, with optional support for CUDA devices. It can be built using the following procedure.

First, download **symPACK** as follows:


```
git clone git@github.com:symPACK/symPACK.git  /path/to/sympack

```

## External dependencies
---------------------------

### UPC++

**SymPACK** requires the [**UPC++ v1.0**](https://upcxx.lbl.gov) library to be installed. The minimum supported version of UPC++ is 2019.9.0. 
If you wish the use the GPU mode of **symPACK**, UPC++ must be configured for CUDA support and the minimum supported version of UPC+ is 2022.3.0. 
UPC++ can be downloaded at [upcxx.lbl.gov](https://upcxx.lbl.gov).

UPC++ provides a CMake config file which **symPACK** uses to link to the UPC++ library. 
The UPC++ compiler wrappers need to either be in your `$PATH`, or the UPC++ install path
can be provided to CMake as follows:
```
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/upcxx
``` 

### Ordering libraries
Several environment variables can be optionally set before configuring the build:

- `metis_PREFIX` = Installation directory for **MeTiS**

- `parmetis_PREFIX` = Installation directory for **ParMETIS**

- `scotch_PREFIX` = Installation directory for **SCOTCH**

- `ptscotch_PREFIX` = Installation directory for **PT-SCOTCH**

Then, create a build directory, enter that directory and type:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/sympack -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/upcxx
 ...OPTIONS... /path/to/sympack

```

The `...OPTIONS...` can be one of the following:

- `-DENABLE_METIS=ON|OFF` to make **MeTiS** ordering available in **symPACK** (`metis_PREFIX` must be set in the environment)

- `-DENABLE_PARMETIS=ON|OFF` to make **ParMETIS** ordering available in **symPACK** (`parmetis_PREFIX` must be set in the environment, `metis_PREFIX` is required as well)

- `-DENABLE_SCOTCH=ON|OFF` to make **SCOTCH** ordering available in **symPACK** (`scotch_PREFIX` must be set in the environment)

- `-DENABLE_PTSCOTCH=ON|OFF` to make **PT-SCOTCH** ordering available in **symPACK** (`ptscotch_PREFIX` must be set in the environment, `scotch_PREFIX` is required as well)

### CUDA Libraries
To enable the GPU mode of **symPACK** for CUDA devices, use the `-DENABLE_CUDA=ON|OFF` build option. Note that this build option is deactivated by default. 

**symPACK's** GPU mode requires CUDA version 6.0 or later. It also requires the `cuBLAS` and `cuSolver` libraries, both of which can be found in CUDA Toolkit 8.0 or later.

### Notes for specific platforms

Some platforms have preconfigured toolchain files which can be used by adding the following option to the `cmake` command:

```
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/sympack/toolchains/mysystem.cmake
(mysystem.cmake should be replaced with the name of the toolchain file)
```

A sample toolchain file can be found in `/path/to/sympack/toolchains/build_config.cmake` and customized for the target platform.

## Building symPACK
---------------------------

The `cmake` command will configure the build process, which can now start by typing:
```
make
make install
```

Additionally, a standalone driver for **symPACK** can be built by typing `make run_sympack2D`.

### Build options

**SymPACK** has several optional features. We have already mentioned the options related to sparse matrix ordering. The following list is the complete set of options available when building **symPACK**:

- `-DENABLE_METIS` to enable **MeTiS** ordering (`ON|OFF`)

- `-DENABLE_PARMETIS` to enable **ParMETIS** ordering (`ON|OFF`)

- `-DENABLE_SCOTCH` to enable **SCOTCH** ordering (`ON|OFF`)

- `-DENABLE_PTSCOTCH` to enable **PT-SCOTCH** ordering (`ON|OFF`)

- `-DAMD_IDX_64` to use 64 bit integers for AMD ordering (`ON|OFF`)

- `-DMMD_IDX_64` to use 64 bit integers for MMD ordering (`ON|OFF`)

- `-DRCM_IDX_64` to use 64 bit integers for RCM ordering (`ON|OFF`)

- `-DENABLE_MKL` to enable Intel MKL through the `-mkl` flag (`ON|OFF`)

- `-DENABLE_THREADS` to enable multithreading (`ON|OFF`). `UPCXX_THREADMODE=par` is required during cmake configuration. **SymPACK** implements its own multithreading and as such should be linked with **sequential** BLAS/LAPACK libraries.

- `-DENABLE_CUDA` to enable CUDA mode. This allows certain sufficiently large computations to be offloaded to CUDA devices (`ON|OFF`)

# Running symPACK
---------------------------

**SymPACK** uses both **UPC++** and **MPI**, therefore, some preliminary environment variables may need to be defined on most platforms.
More details can be found in the **UPC++** [documentation](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/upcxx/wiki/docs/mpi-hybrid):
```
export UPCXX_NETWORK=udp #good option on most workstations, but NOT on high performance networks 
export GASNET_SPAWNFN='C'
export GASNET_CSPAWN_CMD='mpirun -np %N %C'
```

**SymPACK** offers a standalone driver that can be used to run and benchmark **symPACK**'s performance on a single sparse matrix. This driver is located in `driver/run_sympack2D.cpp`. Note that the `run_sympack.cpp` driver uses a less efficient factorization algorithm than the one used by `run_sympack2D.cpp`, so it is recommended to almost always use `run_sympack2D.cpp`. 

To run the standalone **symPACK** driver, for instance on a sample problem from the [Suite Sparse matrix collection](https://sparse.tamu.edu),
the procedure below can be followed:
```
#first download the input matrix (we are using nasa2146 here)
wget https://sparse.tamu.edu/RB/Nasa/nasa2146.tar.gz
#extract the matrix
tar xzf nasa2146.tar.gz

#run sympack
upcxx-run -n 4 -- ./run_sympack2D -in nasa2146/nasa2146.rb -ordering MMD -nrhs 1
```
For larger problems, like [audikw_1](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/RB/GHS_psdef/audikw_1.tar.gz), it is strongly advised to use more efficient orderings (such as **METIS**).
The default ordering is **MMD**. To use another ordering, include the command line argument `-ordering <ORDERING_LIBRARY>`.
Note that to run **symPACK**, `upcxx-run` is used in the example above, but on some platforms, such as NERSC Perlmutter,
other launchers may be used to both spawn **MPI** and **UPC++**, such as `srun` if the system is using SLURM.
Moreover, for larger problems, the `-shared-heap XX` argument to `upcxx-run` may be needed (Please refer to [**UPC++** documentation](https://upcxx.lbl.gov/site)).

# GPU Mode Options
---------------------------
**SymPACK** provides several optional command line options that allow the user to configure certain aspects of the GPU mode. They are summarized here:

- `-gpu_v` activates verbose mode, which will cause a call to `symPACK_cuda_setup()` to print the values of certain tuning parameters related to the GPU mode.
- `-gpu_mem <SIZE>` controls the amount of memory allocated on the GPU upon calling the `symPACK_cuda_setup()` method. One can optionally supply a "M" or "G" unit suffix (e.g. `-gpu\_mem 2.5GB`). If no suffix is included, the allocation size will be interpreted in terms of bytes.  
If this option is not specified, **symPACK** will attempt to partition a device's memory equally among eachprocess bound to the device. For job configurations that have more than one GPU bound to each node, this default behavior may under-estimate the amount of memory that can be allocated on each device. Therefore, for these sorts of job configurations, it is strongly recommended to use this command line option. 
- `-gpu_blk <SIZE>` controls the size threshold (in bytes) that a factorized diagonal block must exceed for it to be automatically copied to the GPU bound to a remote process when being sent to said remote process. This allows for an intermediate copy to host memory to be bypassed, which can reduce communication overhead for certain problems.
- `{trsm, gemm, potrf, syrk}_limit <SIZE>` controls how many nonzero entries a block must have for the given matrix operation (TRSM, GEMM, POTRF, or SYRK) involving said block to be offloaded to the GPU. The GPU will generally be most beneficial for operations involving large blocks with many nonzeros, but the exact size thresholds for when each operation starts to run faster on the GPU will differ between devices.
- `-gpu_solve` determines if the GPU will be used for **symPACK's** triangular solve routine. Defaults to off (use the CPU for the triangular solve).
- `-fallback {cpu, terminate}` determines what **symPACK** will do in the event that an attempt to allocate memory on a device for use in a matrix computation fails due to an insufficient amount of free memory. Setting this option to `cpu` will make it so **symPACK** will simply perform the computation on the CPU instead of the GPU. Setting this option to `terminate` will cause **symPACK** to throw an error and cease execution when a device allocation fails. Defaults to `terminate`
